# Line-Function-1.0
The Line function v.1.0 Uses Bresenham’s algorithm for achieving the goal of creating GUI lines with characters in cmd without flaws on the console. The function calculates all the possible positions of pixels (characters in this case) on the console.  And, then we are printing the specified character in given color on those positions using ‘Batbox’ plugin. Which is responsible for the tremendous speed and response time of the function.
