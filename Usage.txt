 It will help in making batch files little more advanced and effective.
 This file uses 'batbox.exe' plugin for printing lines fastly on console.

 Syntax: call Line [X1] [Y1] [X2] [Y2] [Char | Char Code] [color] [Result]
 Syntax: call Line [help | /? | -h | -help]
 Syntax: call Line ver

 Where:-

 X1		: It is the X Co-ordinate of the Starting point of the line.
 Y1		: It is the Y Co-ordinate of the Starting point of the line.
 X2		: It is the X Co-ordinate of the Ending point of the line.
 Y2		: It is the Y Co-ordinate of the Ending point of the line.
 Char|Char_Code : It maybe either Directly the character or the ASCII
		  Value of the Character.
 Color		: The color of the Line.
 Result		: No need of always specifying this parameter, it is a 
		  special case parameter.In any case, if you needed the
		  code of the Line instead of directly printing it on
		  console, then you can specify this parameter, and the
		  respective code for the Line will be saved into the
		  variable named in this parameter...

 Example: Call Line 15 15 5 5 111 0a
 Example: Call Line 15 15 5 5 o 0a
 Example: Call Line 15 15 5 5 111 0a _Result
 
 Now, you can execute the code saved in '_Result' variable, using 'Batbox.exe'
